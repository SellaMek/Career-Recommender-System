## About the Project
Traditional career guidance often relies on generalized advice, human counselors, or further strategies that offer limited personalization. In contrast, employing machine learning-based career recommender systems utilizes data to connect individuals with suitable career paths based on their interests, skills, and industry trends.

This project develops a Career Recommender System using the Field of Study vs. Occupation dataset from Kaggle to analyze key factors such as job satisfaction, industry growth rate, and work-life balance. By integrating methodologies such as natural language processing (NLP), K-Means clustering, and feature engineering, the system filters careers and users to deliver personalized recommendations. The objective of the Career Recommender System is to aid individuals in taking a step towards making more informed career decisions.

## Source Data
Source Data
The source data for this study comes from Field Of Study vs Occupation 1. This is a public dataset through Kaggle which is designed to offer an opportunity for various exploratory studies, including machine learning models. The source data is rich in that it contains 22 attributes and over 30,000 records of factors that concern the occupation of individuals. Below is a snapshot of a few of these features along with the distribution of the occupations.

The dataset contains numerous useful features that are able to be leveraged to facilitate offering occupation recommendation for individuals based on their academic background, job preferences, and other factors. 
The resulting data was consolidated by means of pre-processing, cleaning, and feature engineering which. This enabled the building of a recommender system which can suggest a career based on a userâ€™s information.
